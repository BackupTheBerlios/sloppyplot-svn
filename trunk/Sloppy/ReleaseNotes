Release Notes for SloppyPlot 0.4 (released 2005-08-28)
======================================================

This release features once again many stability fixes.  Most
importantly, I decided to settle on the current file format: Using an
old .spj file will not be a problem in future releases. The location
of the config file has changed according the freedesktop
specifications.



Release Notes for SloppyPlot 0.3 (released 2005-08-24)
======================================================

This release features a lot of bug fixes and little improvements to
the user interface.  The biggest visible change is the addition of a
dialog to modify the dataset columns (add/remove/move/edit).

It is recommended to update matplotlib to the newest version (0.83.1)
