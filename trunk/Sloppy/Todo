(for 0.5.3):
============

- FOCUS FOR THIS RELEASE: Toolbox! For my work I really need to get going
  with the toolbox, otherwise SloppyPlot will not be of any use to me.


- active_layer should be set whenever we use some mpl function, i.e.
  replace backend.active_layer with backend.request_active_layer.





SMALL CLEANUPS TO DO:
=====================

- DS => MSG
- change headers (copyright)
- set svn props properly
- maybe move the importers and templates into the app, so we can
  deprecate 'globals' and replace it by the app. OR simply rename
  application to app, the app instance to app.instance and have
  all vars that were in globals into app (app.templates, etc.)
