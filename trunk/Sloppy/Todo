(for 0.5.3):
============

- FOCUS FOR THIS RELEASE: Toolbox! For my work I really need to get going
  with the toolbox, otherwise SloppyPlot will not be of any use to me.


- Tools: Lines. It is still a little complex....
  Maybe add buttons to add/remove lines and let double-click edit the line... :-)
  After all, checkwidgets work.

- Tools: The first layer should be selected as active by default.
  This does not yet work perfectly. Maybe it is selected, but the tool waits
  on an update signal?


SMALL CLEANUPS TO DO:
=====================

- DS => MSG
- change headers (copyright)
- set svn props properly
- maybe move the importers and templates into the app, so we can
  deprecate 'globals' and replace it by the app. OR simply rename
  application to app, the app instance to app.instance and have
  all vars that were in globals into app (app.templates, etc.)
