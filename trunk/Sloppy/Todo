BUGFIXES TO BE DONE
====================

- DatasetView: allow to change field name also in ModifyTableDialog

- transform file format from 0.5.1

- projectio: import_from_table stuff.
  => right now, the dataset is loaded because the datawin has a get_array
     call. Of course we must do this somehow different....
     maybe set _array to property(..., set_array)

- Importer: remove checkboxes from widgets....

- if clicking on 'apply' or any other button in the layer window,
  we need to apply all changes that are not yet active.  Maybe by
  moving focus to the current button?

- check if we really want to have None values for some object properties, e.g.
  line.label, ...

- Signals.connect_once -> requires an additional flag in the SignalContainer
