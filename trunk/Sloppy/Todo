BUGFIXES TO BE DONE
====================

- is_internal should be renamed to 'immutable'

- DatasetView: allow to change field name 

- dataset signal 'notify' => dataview does not update properly...
  => there is a model.row_changed(path, iter) method.
  I guess if there are more than, say, 20 rows involved, it might
  be smart to tell the model that everything has changed.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- transform file format from 0.5.1

- projectio: import_from_table stuff.
  => right now, the dataset is loaded because the datawin has a get_array
     call. Of course we must do this somehow different....
     maybe set _array to property(..., set_array)

- Importer: remove checkboxes from widgets....

- Allow to specify format for column view (e.g. %2.3f for floats)

- when switching the view, we first should leave focus, because otherwise
  you might see remnants from combo boxes

- if clicking on 'apply' or any other button in the layer window,
  we need to apply all changes that are not yet active.  Maybe by
  moving focus to the current button?

- check if we really want to have None values for some object properties, e.g.
  line.label, ...

- extra option: autotitles: if set to off, then only plots that do have a
  label are given a title (gnuplot: set key noautotitles)

- aspect ratio of figures should be preserved.

- Signals.connect_once -> requires an additional flag in the SignalContainer
