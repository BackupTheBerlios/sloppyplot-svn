(for 0.5.3):
============

- fix dragging of dockables

- bugfix for data cursor: if mpl handles the left/right, then don't let
  gtk handle it!

- add cursor position in status bar and let all widgets call the status-
  bar of the app (maybe via a signal: 'push-status', context, msg and
  for the special case of coordinates: 'push-coordinates', x, y)

- put Dataset into notebooks as well.  This will unify the undo.

- remember heights of the dockbooks

- open the first available plot for testing

- check_out doesn't work (try modifiying the title of the layer)


About handling little changes:

  SPObject emits two signals, whenever a checked attribute is changed:
  'update::attribute' where attribute is the name of the changed
  attribute and 'update' which includes the attribute name in the
  callbacks argument.

  ATTEMPT ONE
  -----------

  Imagine that we had another signal 'before-update', similiar to 'update':

  - 'before-update': obj.updated_attrs = ... (list of updated attributes)
  - each 'update::xxx' handles one attribute and if it can handle it
    successfully, removes the item from obj.updated_attrs
  - 'update' checks if there are items left in obj.updated_attrs and if
    not, updates everything


  ATTEMPT TWO
  -----------




SMALL CLEANUPS TO DO:
=====================

- change headers (copyright)
- set svn props properly
- maybe move the importers and templates into the app, so we can
  deprecate 'globals' and replace it by the app. OR simply rename
  application to app, the app instance to app.instance and have
  all vars that were in globals into app (app.templates, etc.)
