Checkwidgets
============

- what about the line source? This requires a custom widget -- so write it!

  => this DisplayLineSource should be very similar to the DisplayLine widget
     in Plugins/PeakFinder/gui_gtk.py
     It should display the name of the Dataset.

     Of course, this assumes that the name (well, the 'key' attribute actually)
     is either stored in the Dataset itself, or that we need to look it up
     in the list of datasets by the project.

     Do we really need unique keys? Yes, (1) for scripting, (2) for the 
     XML output file.

     IF THE PROJECT.DATASETS WERE A DICT, then we would still need to iterate
     over all items, because it would be a value lookup...
   
     Another question: Is it really sensible to have dataset.source be a
     real object. If it were a string, then we could also have formulas
     and the like. Of course, I would have the rename problem... It would
     be very easy, on the other hand, to add an additional pseudo dataset,
     the 'custom function' dataset, which would mean that dataset.source is
     set to 'None' and we look at the field dataset.source_func instead
     (being the equivalent to gnuplots '=...' syntax).


 
Property Editor
================

- Clicking on a part of the graph should send out a signal
   'user-pick'
  from the backend, which the OmniTool should catch and move the
  treeview cursor to that element.

  This would require a conversion from the matplotlib element to
  the logical element.


- Add nice icons to the TreeView elements

- Selecting more than one item should gray out the object editor

- Right-clicking should preserve the selection and display e.g. the popup
  for a Line, if only Line objects are selected.
  

PeakFinder Tool
===============

- Ergebnisse des PeakFinders evtl. in ein Dataset übergeben und dieses
  dann anzeigen lassen?

- Zuordnung Peaks -> Symbol

- Peaks als solche der Zeichnung hinzufügen

- Peaks abspeichern (evtl. Log?)


MPL Backend
===========

- 'paint' can be called from other methods and shouldn't queue a redraw.
  Only on_update methods should!
 

Docks/Tools in General
======================

- The tools have a problem: Close the omni tool, leave SloppyPlot.
  Restart SloppyPlot, open the omni tool, then select the first plot.
  The Omni Tool will not be updated, I guess this is because the active
  backend hasn't changed but was already set.

- Migrate Plot window to some kind of Tool (would allow reordering). 
  - Make Plot active when you click in the explorer.
  - Allow closing a Plot (Maybe we could simply add a button in the notebook tab)
  - close a plot as a menu point

- fix dragging of dockables (when moving to the bottom separator, the tool
  is not moved to the end) 

- put Dataset into notebooks as well.  This will unify the undo.

- Plot and Dataset are descendants of DockableView
  (uistring, actions, title).

- allow detaching tools into separate windows (problem: saving)

- not every toolbox allows every tool!
  
- remember heights of the dockbooks

- open the first available plot for testing

- minimum size for sidepane

- synchronize tools with backend -- if backend closes, they should discard
  their data as well
  

MISC BUGS
=========

- layer logarithmisch machen funktioniert nicht immer: Bei negativen Achsen-
  werten läuft Matplotlib expose_event in eine üble Exception-Reihe.

- wenn backend ausgewählt wird, aktualisiert sich die Layer nicht selbst...

- bugfix for data cursor: if mpl handles the left/right, then don't let
  gtk handle it!

- add cursor position in status bar and let all widgets call the status-
  bar of the app (maybe via a signal: 'push-status', context, msg and
  for the special case of coordinates: 'push-coordinates', x, y)

- Adding Tools does not always work. I guess the passing of the popuinfo
  is somehow not in sync, i.e. the popupinfo is not yet passed when the tool
  is added.

- Dataset window hat jetzt viele Fehler
  Editing a column (click on the column header), checks in the change, but
  the columns are not updated.

- ctrl-r doppelt belegt (redraw und zoom rectangle)

- changing a line property will replot the line. Unfortunately, this will
  destroy the scale! I think this is kind of an mpl problem.


SMALL CLEANUPS TO DO BEFORE RELEASING
======================================

- uihelper.new_section => new_framebox (more descriptive)

- change headers (copyright)

- set svn props properly

- maybe move the importers and templates into the app, so we can
  deprecate 'globals' and replace it by the app. OR simply rename
  application to app, the app instance to app.instance and have
  all vars that were in globals into app (app.templates, etc.)
