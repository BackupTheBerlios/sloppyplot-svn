(for 0.5.3):
============

- FOCUS FOR THIS RELEASE: Toolbox! For my work I really need to get going
  with the toolbox, otherwise SloppyPlot will not be of any use to me.


- update the whole plot via a signal ?



SMALL CLEANUPS TO DO:
=====================

- DS => MSG
- change headers (copyright)
- set svn props properly
- maybe move the importers and templates into the app, so we can
  deprecate 'globals' and replace it by the app. OR simply rename
  application to app, the app instance to app.instance and have
  all vars that were in globals into app (app.templates, etc.)
