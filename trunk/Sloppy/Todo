BUGFIXES TO BE DONE
====================

- projectio: import_from_table stuff.
  => right now, the dataset is loaded because the datawin has a get_array
     call. Of course we must do this somehow different....
     maybe set _array to property(..., set_array)

- Importer
  - don't display checkboxes ?
  - use Gtk.EntryCombo or whatever it is called for the delimiter.
    The user must be able to choose from a list!

- check if we really want to have None values for some object properties, e.g.
  line.label, ...

- if clicking on 'apply' or any other button in the layer window,
  we need to apply all changes that are not yet active.  Maybe by
  moving focus to the current button?
