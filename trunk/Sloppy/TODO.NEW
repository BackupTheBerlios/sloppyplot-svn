- check XPS and PFC imports

- check if toolbox is visible and adjust the state of the togglebutton on creation of mpl_window.

- set default values

- implement linestyles in gnuplot.

- importer: _first_ remove beginning and end of line using a regular expression,
  _then_ split the remaining string according to the delimiter. (This
  way, we can avoid problems with comments, different linebreaks,...)
  When constructing the delimiter, always append '\s*' ?
