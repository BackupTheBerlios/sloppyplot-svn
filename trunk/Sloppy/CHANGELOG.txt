CHANGELOG
=========


2005-20-24: SloppyPlot 0.3
==========================

Plotting:
  - added row_first, row_last to specify first and last row index
    to use while plotting.  This is still experimental and is only
    supported by matplotlib, not by gnuplot!    
  
Web Site:
  - launched 'real' web site using DokuWiki
    
User Interface:
  - Cleaned up the menus a little (added edit button in mpl window,
    renamed Save As to Export Via Matplotlib,...)
  - fixed some little annoying bugs, e.g. in layerwin
  - replaced the boolean toggle buttons with comboboxes (default,true,false)
    
Dataset Window:
  - implemented Column modification dialog (add/remove/move/edit columns)
  - added status bar to dataset window


SloppyPlot 0.2
==============

- first build considered alpha quality


SloppyPlot 0.1.2
================

- many, many small bugfixes to improve the normal workflow
- list of recently used files available
- added configuration file ~/.sloppyplot.cfg
