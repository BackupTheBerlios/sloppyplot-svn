1. Requirements
===============

Sloppyplot is developed and has been tested under Linux.  Windows
environments are not yet supported, but will be once everything has
been stabilized.

Sloppyplot has a few dependencies which you should be aware of.

The following applications and libraries have to to be installed
before running the program.  Except for python, it is not necessary to
have these dependencies fulfilled at the time of installation.

- python >= 2.4
  http://www.python.org

- pygtk >= 2.6, 
  http://www.pygtk.org

- Numeric >= 23.8 (any recent version should work),
  http://numpy.sf.net

- matplotlib >= 0.83.1
  http://matplotlib.sf.net




I am currently testing analysis functions.  For these, you need to
have the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) and its python bindings
installed.  These dependencies are totally optional! 

- Gnu Scientific Library 1.x
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

- Python Bindings for GSL
  http://pygsl.sourceforge.net/



For the postscript export you need to have Gnuplot installed

- Gnuplot

2. Generic Installation Instructions
====================================

To install, stay in the directory where you found this INSTALL.txt
file and enter:

$ python setup.py install

And you are done.  The executable is called sloppy-gtk




3. Slackware Installation Instructions
======================================

Even without checkinstall (which you should try if you are using
Slackware), you can create a Slackware-compatible package!

$ python setup.py bdist

will build a Slackware-compatible archive in the subdirectory dist.
Just go there, rename the file and install it, e.g.:

$ cd dist
$ mv SloppyPlot-0.4.linux-i686.tar.gz SloppyPlot-0.4-i686-1.tgz
% installpkg SloppyPlot-0.4-i686-1.tgz
