------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Requirements
===============

Sloppyplot is developed and has been tested under Linux.  Windows
environments are not yet supported, but will be once everything has
been stabilized.

The following applications and libraries have to to be installed
before running the program. 


- python >= 2.4
  http://www.python.org

- pygtk 2.6, 
  http://www.pygtk.org

- Numeric (any recent version should work), 
  http://numpy.sf.net

- matplotlib 0.84
  http://matplotlib.sf.net


For the postscript export you need to have Gnuplot installed

- Gnuplot
  www.gnuplot.info


Future versions of SloppyPlot will switch from Numeric to the new
SciPy core.  This transition will take place as soon as matplotlib 
has changed to scipy core which will probably be in version 0.86.



2. Generic Installation Instructions
====================================

To install, stay in the directory where you found this INSTALL.txt
file and enter:

$ python setup.py install

And you are done.  The executable is called sloppyplot




3. Post Installation Instructions 
=================================

For a complete integration into your favorite desktop, you _might_
need to run the following commands as root:


$ update-desktop-database
$ update-mime-database /usr/share/mime

and maybe even

$ gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons

If you know better than I if this is needed, please tell me so!




4. Slackware Installation Instructions
======================================

As root type

$ ./sloppyplot.build

A slackware compatible package is built which you install using
the standard 'installpkg' command.



5. Testing Without Prior Installation
=====================================

SloppyPlot is still under construction.

If you would like to test the application without installing it, then
first make sure that you have the requirements installed as explained
above in this document.

Then in this directory type

  $ ./test-sloppy
  
and enjoy.
