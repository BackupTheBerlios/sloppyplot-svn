1. Requirements
===============

Sloppyplot is developed and has been tested under Linux.  Windows
environments are not yet supported, but will be once everything has
been stabilized.

Sloppyplot has a few dependencies which you should be aware of.

The following applications and libraries have to to be installed
before running the program.  Except for python, it is not necessary to
have these dependencies fulfilled at the time of installation.

- python >= 2.4
  http://www.python.org

- pygtk >= 2.6, 
  http://www.pygtk.org

- Scipy Core 
  (= the new scipy, please be careful not to use the old scipy)
  http://numpy.sf.net

- matplotlib >= 0.83.1
  http://matplotlib.sf.net


For the postscript export you need to have Gnuplot installed

- Gnuplot
  www.gnuplot.info


I am currently testing analysis functions.  For these, you need to
have the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) and its python bindings
installed.  These dependencies are totally optional! 

- Gnu Scientific Library 1.x
  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

- Python Bindings for GSL
  http://pygsl.sourceforge.net/




2. Generic Installation Instructions
====================================
