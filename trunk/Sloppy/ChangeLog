CHANGELOG
=========

2005-09-06 SloppyPlot 0.4.1
===========================
	
  * Put API documentation online (and write script to automate the process)
  * Fixed progress report (at least a little).
  * Rewrote ASCII import to use regular expressions.  This makes it much more powerful.
  * Let ASCII import issue a warning if there were more than 100 errors and let user choose to abort, abort all(=UserCancel) or continue.
  * Adjusted derived import filters (XPS and PFC) to use the regular expressions instead of skip lines.
  * Added API documentation via epydoc
  * Renamed executable to `sloppyplot`
	
	
	
2005-08-28: SloppyPlot 0.4
==========================

There were many, many changes.  Among them are:

  * Created directory 'doc' and moved licenses to it.
  * setup.py now uses all information from version.py (version,author,...)
  * Moved netcdf type conversions to const.py AND reverted this back again! Doing this would introduce a pycdf dependency on the Base dir!
  * Moved application.py to directory Base.
  * In table.py renamed 'rowcount' to 'nrows', 'colcount' to 'ncols'.  This caused a lot of replacing in other modules.
  * Don't add current project to list of recently files if it is the same as the most recent file in the list.
  * Moved all Column information except data, typecode and key into project.xml.
  * Created a sample transformation to show how to convert the project.xml file from an old version to a new one.
  * Synchronized 'legend.border'.
  * Both backends, gnuplot and matplotlib, now share some methods, e.g. for determining the source from a line, the table from a source, the label from a line. These common functions are naturally implemented in backend.py
  * Reworked Props heavily.
  * Use KeyProp for Column keys.
  * Started documentation for directory layout.
  * Removed EPS option for PostscriptTerminal.
  * Added tooltips to Gnuplot export status (actually to propwidgets in general).
  * Moved config file location from $HOME/.sloppyplot to $HOME/.config/SloppyPlot/sloppyrc. The XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is honored.  If the directory does not exist, it is created.
  * Renamed executable to 'sloppy', hide 'CLI' frontend (hey, it is not cli, it's actually a shell frontend!)
  * Added options to executable.  Now it is possible to specify the project filename.
  * check key if setting it automatically via the importer.  It might contain invalid characters!
  * Import files regardless if they have unix or windows line-feed!


2005-08-24: SloppyPlot 0.3
==========================

Plotting:
  - added row_first, row_last to specify first and last row index
    to use while plotting.  This is still experimental and is only
    supported by matplotlib, not by gnuplot!    
  
Web Site:
  - launched 'real' web site using DokuWiki
    
User Interface:
  - Cleaned up the menus a little (added edit button in mpl window,
    renamed Save As to Export Via Matplotlib,...)
  - fixed some little annoying bugs, e.g. in layerwin
  - replaced the boolean toggle buttons with comboboxes (default,true,false)
    
Dataset Window:
  - implemented Column modification dialog (add/remove/move/edit columns)
  - added status bar to dataset window


SloppyPlot 0.2
==============

- first build considered alpha quality


SloppyPlot 0.1.2
================

- many, many small bugfixes to improve the normal workflow
- list of recently used files available
- added configuration file ~/.sloppyplot.cfg
