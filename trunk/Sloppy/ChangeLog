CHANGELOG
=========

2005-xx-yy SloppyPlot 0.5.2
===========================

  * Renamed configuration path to lowercase 'sloppyplot'.  
    Only in release notes, web pages and so on is the mixed
    spelling "SloppyPlot" used.

  * Much of the code has been rewritten, but most of these changes should
    not be visible to the user. Examples are the Property system, the gtk
    widget creation, the plugin system and the underlying data structure.

  * The dataset window has been modified slightly.
  
	

2005-12-01 SloppyPlot 0.5.1
===========================

  * Added complete desktop integration, i.e. SloppyPlot will appear in 
    your desktop menu. In addition .spj project files should have an 
    icon and are clickable from any modern file manager.

  * Added drag and drop support for the project explorer. You can now
    drop files to import or drop a single sloppyplot project file and
    they will be handled accordingly.
   
  * Reworked the whole ASCII importer.  It is now possible to extract
    column keys.  Importer settings can be saved as templates.  A
    'skip_options' option allows you to specify settings for a template
    and have them applied automatically for certain file types.
    
  * A Preferences dialog has been added, which currently only allows to
    edit the ASCII import templates.   
  
  * Verbosity has been increased by putting short status messages into
    the status bar after each user action.

  * Added build script to create packages for Slackware Linux
	
  * lots of internal API changes, see SVN logs for details
  
  * lots of bugfixes.



2005-11-16 SloppyPlot 0.5.0
===========================

  * See SVN logs for further details.  Sorry.


2005-10-18 SloppyPlot 0.4.5
===========================

  * See SVN logs for further details


2005-10-06 SloppyPlot 0.4.4
===========================
	
  * renamed update_sobject with update_layer.  This is more consistent!
  * disconnect signals if project/plot/layer changes.  fixed log problem
  * with matplotlib.  This was actually a matplotlib problem which
    occured when legend placement was 'best'.
  * Undo/Redo text is now properly displayed in the menu!!!
  * Added support for ValueDict in pwconnect.ComboBox
  * Replaced OptionsDialog by a far better one, which also provides tooltips
    for the items.
  * Found a good place for 'create_changeset' => In HasProps !
  * replace ColumnPropertiesDialog with the new OptionsDialog
  * Added Testsuites directory with two testsuites.
	

2005-09-21 SloppyPlot 0.4.3	
===========================

  * No detailed Changelog available due to lack of time. Please look
    at the SVN log, each change has been documented there.
	

2005-09-11 SloppyPlot 0.4.2
===========================
	
  * Replaced types,transform,values by check approach. This is so much more powerful and simpler.
  * Re-implemented WeakRefProp/WeakRefMetaAttribute.
  * created simple TestSuite
  * renamed most Props, e.g. StringProp became pString
  * Initial version of MapValue
  * Via default, all checks except pure value Checks should accept None as valid.  If None should not be allowed, use CheckInvalid(None).
  * you can now specify either a value or a function/method for keyword parameters 'check' and 'reset'
  * Prop.check_value has been replaced by Prop.check
  * Added epydoc extra field for props.
  * Added epydoc version information, at least to Sloppy, so that one can check the api documentation version.
  * Removed RangeProp
  * Moved Gtk.pwconnect to Props.Gtk to make it a more integrated part of Props.

	
2005-09-06 SloppyPlot 0.4.1
===========================
	
  * Put API documentation online (and write script to automate the process)
  * Fixed progress report (at least a little).
  * Rewrote ASCII import to use regular expressions.  This makes it much more powerful.
  * Let ASCII import issue a warning if there were more than 100 errors and let user choose to abort, abort all(=UserCancel) or continue.
  * Adjusted derived import filters (XPS and PFC) to use the regular expressions instead of skip lines.
  * Added API documentation via epydoc
  * Renamed executable to `sloppyplot`
	
	
	
2005-08-28: SloppyPlot 0.4
==========================

There were many, many changes.  Among them are:

  * Created directory 'doc' and moved licenses to it.
  * setup.py now uses all information from version.py (version,author,...)
  * Moved netcdf type conversions to const.py AND reverted this back again! Doing this would introduce a pycdf dependency on the Base dir!
  * Moved application.py to directory Base.
  * In table.py renamed 'rowcount' to 'nrows', 'colcount' to 'ncols'.  This caused a lot of replacing in other modules.
  * Don't add current project to list of recently files if it is the same as the most recent file in the list.
  * Moved all Column information except data, typecode and key into project.xml.
  * Created a sample transformation to show how to convert the project.xml file from an old version to a new one.
  * Synchronized 'legend.border'.
  * Both backends, gnuplot and matplotlib, now share some methods, e.g. for determining the source from a line, the table from a source, the label from a line. These common functions are naturally implemented in backend.py
  * Reworked Props heavily.
  * Use KeyProp for Column keys.
  * Started documentation for directory layout.
  * Removed EPS option for PostscriptTerminal.
  * Added tooltips to Gnuplot export status (actually to propwidgets in general).
  * Moved config file location from $HOME/.sloppyplot to $HOME/.config/SloppyPlot/sloppyrc. The XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable is honored.  If the directory does not exist, it is created.
  * Renamed executable to 'sloppy', hide 'CLI' frontend (hey, it is not cli, it's actually a shell frontend!)
  * Added options to executable.  Now it is possible to specify the project filename.
  * check key if setting it automatically via the importer.  It might contain invalid characters!
  * Import files regardless if they have unix or windows line-feed!


2005-08-24: SloppyPlot 0.3
==========================

Plotting:
  - added row_first, row_last to specify first and last row index
    to use while plotting.  This is still experimental and is only
    supported by matplotlib, not by gnuplot!    
  
Web Site:
  - launched 'real' web site using DokuWiki
    
User Interface:
  - Cleaned up the menus a little (added edit button in mpl window,
    renamed Save As to Export Via Matplotlib,...)
  - fixed some little annoying bugs, e.g. in layerwin
  - replaced the boolean toggle buttons with comboboxes (default,true,false)
    
Dataset Window:
  - implemented Column modification dialog (add/remove/move/edit columns)
  - added status bar to dataset window


SloppyPlot 0.2
==============

- first build considered alpha quality


SloppyPlot 0.1.2
================

- many, many small bugfixes to improve the normal workflow
- list of recently used files available
- added configuration file ~/.sloppyplot.cfg
