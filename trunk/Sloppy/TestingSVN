SloppyPlot is still under construction.

If you would like to test the application, then install the
requirements (see INSTALL.txt).  Then, from this directory, type

  $ source adjust_path.sh

This will set your $PYTHONPATH variable to the source path, so that
'import Sloppy' will import the module from this directory.  So there
is no need to install SloppyPlot!

Then execute the program by typing

  $ cd src
  $ python sloppyplot


Have fun!


Feedback is very welcome!
