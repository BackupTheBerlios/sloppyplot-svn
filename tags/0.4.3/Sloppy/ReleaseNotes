Release Notes for SloppyPlot 0.4.2 (released 2005-09-11)
========================================================

This release is the second one in the 0.4.x series that will focus on
code cleanup and api documentation.  There are _no_ user visible
changes, _but_ the Props system (similar to basicproperty or to the
traits system) has been reworked, restructured and is even documented!


Release Notes for SloppyPlot 0.4.1 (released 2005-09-06)
========================================================

This release is the first one in the 0.4.x series that will focus on
code cleanup and api documentation. The only real visible feature will
probably be the gradual improvement of the ASCII import dialog, which
has already started with this release. 



Release Notes for SloppyPlot 0.4 (released 2005-08-28)
======================================================

This release features once again many stability fixes.  Most
importantly, I decided to settle on the current file format: Using an
old .spj file will not be a problem in future releases. The location
of the config file has changed according the freedesktop
specifications.



Release Notes for SloppyPlot 0.3 (released 2005-08-24)
======================================================

This release features a lot of bug fixes and little improvements to
the user interface.  The biggest visible change is the addition of a
dialog to modify the dataset columns (add/remove/move/edit).

It is recommended to update matplotlib to the newest version (0.83.1)
